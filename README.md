Collection of simple ROS models. The models has increased complexity and is good as beginner level tutorials.

## A few tips
1. If you've just catkin_maked your workspace with your second package: 1) make sure to source /path/to/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash again (you'll have to do this after every package addition / removal) and 2) run rospack profile to force an update of the package cache that roscd uses. #2 is not mentioned in many tutorials.
